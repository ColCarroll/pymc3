# Guidelines for Contributing
We recommend you open any issues on [Gitub Issues](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues)

#Pull requests

We gladly welcome pull requests.

Before making any changes, we recommend opening an issue (if it doesn’t already exist) and discussing your proposed changes. This will let us give you feedback on whether the changes should be made and advice on how they should be made. If the changes are minor, then feel free to make them without discussion.

##Style guide. 
Follow [TensorFlow’s](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/style_guide.html) style guide for writing code, which more or less follows PEP 8.
